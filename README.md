# Splitter

This contract application receives ether, and splits it between two accounts known as Alpha and Beta.

Issues: When I attempt to deploy, I get the following error regarding my solidity file: `Could not find expected contract or library in 'splitter.sol': contract or library 'splitter' not found.`
